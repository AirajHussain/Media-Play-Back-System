# Media Play Back System 
The Media Playback System is a distributed application designed for centralized control of audio playback across multiple devices in a home environment. Built using Java 23, the AudioMixer library, and the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) API, the system allows users to:

- Upload and manage audio files (.MP3, .WAV).
- Queue and play tracks on any connected media device.
- Control playback, adjust volume, and switch devices dynamically.

The server handles client requests using RMI, supporting real-time, multi-device audio playback. The system is scalable, intuitive, and sets the foundation for future enhancements such as fault tolerance, cloud connectivity, and improved user interfaces.

# Setup Intstructions 

## Compilation

### Server
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd /(folder_name)/server
   ```
2. Compile all server-side Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

### Client
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd /(folder_name)/client
   ```
2. Compile all client-side Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

---

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Start `rmiregistry`
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd /(folder_name)/server
   ```
2. Start the `rmiregistry` on your preferred port (default: `1099`):
   ```bash
   rmiregistry 1099
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Server
1. Open a new terminal.
2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd /(folder_name)/server
   ```
3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   java MediaServer
   ```

### Step 3: Start the Client
1. Open another terminal.
2. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd /(folder_name)/client
   ```
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   java MediaClient
   ```

## Terminal Setup
You should have **three separate terminals**:
1. One for the `rmiregistry`.
2. One for the server (`MediaServer`).
3. One for the client (`MediaClient`).
